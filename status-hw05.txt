7. How did you handle cards flipping back after a set timeout?

I handled cards flipping back after a set timeout by adding a 'displayed' field
to the state. This field would be changed by a display method 0.5 seconds before
the choice logic was actually performed. Through this new method, I could
display the card that I was clicking on, and then determine what to do with that
card.
